The TV puns are witty playing off the timeless classic and modernize it to fit the cut throat TV industry, and a desensitized generation.Bill Murray is at his best with his zany SNL throwbacks, impressions and being funny the way he used to be (although I haven't seen him in ages.) The ghosts of past & present (Carol Kane) & Bob Cathwaite are hilarious. Other role players including John Forsythe and Robert Mitchum provide good characterization. This movie is 35 years old and it never gets old as my family and I can recite the lines in this film verbatim and laugh every time.",

He plays a network executive who is clearly unhappy with the choices he has made, and through the magic of Christmas he is visited by three ghosts like in a Christmas Carol. It is a retelling of it, but one that is more modern, and still firm set in the greed is good era of the 1980s. This film came out when I was eleven, and I think my parents picked up a VHS copy shortly after. I wanted to watch a Christmas movie with my kids, and they didn't want to watch Gremlins for some reason, so I chose this one. I remember every little detail, and the practical effects are amazing. The rotting corpse whose arm gets torn off is still creepy today. It's a pretty dark Christmas film, which leads to me to wonder why were the films of my childhood a bit dark, and now films for children are so antiseptic?",

(for the 80's) was a great idea, and kudos with Scrooge being a ruthless, disconnected TV exec, but there was just so much more left to be desired in this version of the classic Dicken's tale. As the film goes on, it just starts to become nonsense and many scenes are just loud and irritating. The ghost of Christmas present was downright terrible and completely unfunny. I had a bit of difficulty following the film as it was all over the place and it felt like it's was just jumping from scene to scene without any direction. The biggest issue was that, for a rendition of A Christmas Carol, it lacked heart. The ending felt rushed and disjointed and seeing Scrooge's redemption, which is my favorite part of the story, was so unsatisfying. All in all, the movie is mostly unfunny, annoying, dull, and rather simple minded. It also lacks that emotion other versions really captured with this story. If you're considering watching it, I say give this one a pass.",

And while you would think that the spirit of xmas would be lost with this approach, the movie remains nostalgic and really brings the feel good factor that is required in a xmas movie. The supporting cast are also fantastic with Bobcat Goldthwait delivering a brilliant and again hilarious performance. The Movie is defo of the era with similarities to other Bill Murray Classics such as groundhog day. By far my favourite Xmas movie and a real treat for all the family. I am very much a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas Entertainment, but if you want something that is a bit leftfield but still makes you come back for that xmas hit , year after year. You can't go wrong with Scrooged.",

                "review_title": "Hilarious 80s update of \"A Christmas Carol\"",
                "review_text": "\"Scrooged\" is one of the most hilarious Christmas films ever made but it's surprisingly controversial or at least unpopular among some fans of Christmas movies. Maybe it's expectations. For those who say it's not a literal version of Dickens' story, well, it's not. It's inspired and loosely based on it. Many people complain that the character is too dark or that they can't like him enough to root for him. But this is not \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and Bill Murray isn't Jimmy Stewart. I don't think anyone watching any of the actual films of \"A Christmas Carol\" or even reading the story would say they could relate to Scrooge or see any hope for him.. When asked to help the poor by charity workers, he answers \"If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.\" Scrooge is a dark character, so far it would seem from any hope of redemption that when it comes it's all the more joyful.Secondly, \"Scrooged\" is basically a farce and so by its very nature everything is exaggerated. That's how a farce works. If Bill Murray's character had been a mildly grumpy man it would have fallen flat. Everything is exaggerated to its maximum effect. Bill Murray's Frank Cross isn't bad, he's horrible. As the movie begins he does something awful, then he does something even worse, then he tops even that, totally plumbing the depths of being an unprincipled scoundrel. There's seemingly no limit to how awful Frank Cross can be. Murray's deadpan delivery and general air of condescension embody the character perfectly. He plays it beautifully, too: no winks at the camera, just totally straight as the boss from hell. It's his film, he had to carry it and he did.The film was directed by action movie director Richard Donner between \"Lethal Weapon I and II. The production became well known for its general air of disagreement between Donner, Murray and screenwriters Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue. Each seemed to have their own idea of the film, with the writers saying Donner did not know how to shoot comedy and not liking Murray's improvisations, which included the major speech he gives at the end. Donner thought Murray was difficult but admired his professionalism. Murray had not made a picture since \"Ghostbusters: four years earlier and felt stressed by the pressure to carry the film. He also suffered some physical reactions to the artificial snow, but this might have actually improved his portrayal of Cross..Somehow it all worked out. It's a bit long here and there and Fran;s change of heart seems a bit too sudden, but that's what the story is about.The film knocks you out of any preconceived expectations by opening with Donner satirizing himself with an armed invasion of Santa's Workshop at the North Pole (\"The Day the Reindeer Died\":). It features an actual action star, then goes off in several other unexpected directions until you don't know what will happen next and that's the general way the whole film is. It's also loaded with unexpected casting and surprise cameos which are all part of the fun. Some of this may have lost some effect as time has gone by and new viewers may not understand some of the references, but it's still a funny film even if you don't know who all the actors are. It also satirizes the notion that any publicity is good publicity, the industry obsession with awards and the quest for network ratings. The supporting cast is excellent, even Murray's own younger brother playing Frank Cross's younger brother James. The film was a hit in 1988, though not a huge hit. Over subsequent decades it has picked up many fans and is now a holiday classic.",

                "review_text": "Coolest thing about this film is how it spins the Christmas carol formula. With hundreds of different Christmas carol films always taking place in the same time period just with different actors or different characters. This movie brings life by making it very modern, at least for the late 80s. Bill Murray plays a film producer working on a Christmas carol film whose life mirrors Scrooge. The ghosts in this film are hilarious and have some of the best scenes, the new plot twists and threads are interesting although feel slightly unrealistic, although considering how slapstick this film is that shouldn't really be a problem. My biggest gripe with this film is I just didn't find it funny, it had all the perfect jokes to be funny but nothing overly made me laugh out loud, bill Murray also shouts a whole lot for some reason. With that being said this is still a very good Christmas classic and an awesome take on a Christmas carol.",

Like his old girlfriend would be so into him and immediately swoon the minute he pays attention to her (right after making out with a solid gold dancer on live tv - haha hilareous right?). It is so ridiculous. In the end he doesn't seem redeemed he just seems insane. Like seriously a mental breakdown right before he commits suicide. His assistent holds the studio at gunpoint (which def isn't funny anymore) while he makes a truly deranged speech while crying. It's more disturbing than sweet. Maybe that was the point. I'm not entirely sure. I guess I don't get it. Now I can cross it off my list. It's like how wes anderson has just got too wes anderson. This is the same. Just too much free reign bill murray.

I understand the Scrooge-character is supposed to be unlikable but Murray's character is unlikeable in an obnoxious sort of way that it makes it hard to believe he's redeemable.

First, as Katniss ascends the tube to the arena, Once (more than once?) when she's in the arena, and once more in the last couple of minutes of the film.We had the same kind of crazed in the latter seasons of Handmaid's Tale; one presumes the directors didn't have a robust imagination for alternatives than \"crazed expression #24\".It's as if the characters, contrary to most reasonable people I think, actually hadn't reached the point of not being surprised by anything that might occur, in spite of all that has occurred to date.Otherwise, a very good film, well done all-around.",

This film took the best elements from the first film and REALLY expanded upon them.The first film introduced the idea of the games to us, but this film gave us the argument and philosophy of why the games existed in the first place. This film also did a great job with expanding the world of Panem and it's character storytelling.As far as character moments go, there were alot of great moments from both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. Both of them struggling with life after the Games, and how they deal with the\nsavagery they've witnessed while going through another round of even more savagery in this film. Both are at there peak in this film and continue to shine and grow.Shoutout to Donald Sutherland though. We definitly get to spend more time with him in this film and we really get to see more of what drives him to do what he does, and we get to see some really awesome moments between his character President Snow, and Katniss Everdeen.The imagery and cinematography I believe have really stepped up since the last movie. There were some really beautiful shots. And the music is even more of a standout in this one.Other than that, like I said before, the action is a lot more savage than previous, and definitely more faster paced in my opinion. The Choreography and the action scenes were done really well.I know people say that this film may be the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, but in my opinion, both the 1st and 2nd could be potentially tied for first in my mind.

The only reason I watch these movies is to get ready for the upcoming one now in November. But about this one. Well, it was just ok. The plot is taking place just after part one, and things are starting to get out of control when Katniss Everdeen is changing the Hunger Games, and starts to make people mad. After that it goes a while and a new Hunger Games is out once again, with the same characters from part one. So honestly, nothing new was changed, just a new game. You know they are going to survive, because it's too predictable. Some new challenges but didn't impress too much. But I have to admit that part two was better made than the original one. The stunts were creative and well done. Great camera-work and epic angles, what gave this an extra cinematic experience. Entertaining for most time, so I give most points for that. They showed a bigger connection between the friend group in the games, but I wished some more character development form the main characters. I also wished they could show more of the world outside, because they haven't showed it so much yet. And the music. Well, The Hunger Games theme is fun to listen, but not for the thousand time. They could put more variety in the music score. The nostalgic and heroic theme was getting my out of control sometimes. But overall, this wasn't such a bad movie. It got some technical and historical problems that I would change, but at the same time it was very entertaining and good action included, with a pretty cool cliffhanger at the end! So if you liked the first one, then you should watch this one, too, but don't have high expectations.",

However, in this second film the screenwriters and director are different. This detail completely changed the quality of the sequel, making it far superior to its predecessor. Even though it's better, it's still nothing incredible and revolutionary. It's a generic film with interesting scenes, but in the end it doesn't become anything memorable. The first act is the most interesting moment and best explores this problematic system in the universe of The Hunger Games. After the first act, we enter again into a dull story that serves as an excuse to become yet another generic action film. There's nothing special about the film, but it manages to be fun at different times.",

Many attempts to recapture the turtle magic had fallen flatter than a deflated pizza crust. However, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and the writers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem pleasantly surprised me, delivering the best TMNT content in decades.Featuring actual teenagers as the voice cast adds a pepperoni twist to the turtles, infusing their characters with the energy and idiocy of adolescence. The tangents and teenage spirals perfectly capture that age, earning a ninja nod of approval. The rest of the cast, a deep roster of talent, brings the characters to life with flair.Ditching the usual focus on the Shredder and the Foot Clan, the film takes a refreshing turn with Ice Cube's Superfly and a rogues' gallery of secondary villains. It's a topping of variety that's been missing in previous TMNT projects.The animation is as unique as a turtle shell, and Mutant Mayhem does for TMNT what Into the Spider-Verse did for Spider-Man, giving it a fresh and visually captivating spin.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score, like the perfect blend of cheese and tomato sauce, hits all the right notes. Their fusion of acoustic and electronic elements creates a varied soundtrack that complements each scene like the perfect pizza pairing.After enduring some disappointing Michael Bay-produced films, this reboot was like a pizza delivery in a half shell, exactly what the TMNT franchise needed. Bring on the sequel, and let the turtles keep kicking shell with their newfound freshness! A turtle power revival that's as satisfying as a slice with all your favorite toppings.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.Upscaled 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",

                "review_text": "The problem with origin super hero movies is they're all the same on the surface, that's why Spider-Man Homecoming skipped Peter Parker's whole origin story because we've heard it a thousand times, but TMNT isn't quite as popular so they had to go over the basics. As a result, the characters and animation are fun, but the story could have been written by an AI. A sequel should take care of that though. In the next movie, we'll have these fun charters already established and the story can go wherever they want to take it, which is exciting!Speaking of the characters, they're super fun and acted by actual teenagers! They're pretty annoying but in a \"teenaged boys having harmless fun\" kinda way which I really vibed with.I appreciate the animation isn't the simple 3D Pixar animation we've been seeing for the past 2 decades, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say I thought this was the same studio that made the Spider-Verse movies, turns out they're entirely different and unrelated. I enjoy unique art styles, and they try to separate themselves from the Spider-verse films, but it's obvious that some studio exec said \"I want a movie like the Spider-Verse movies\" and thus we got TMNT Mutant Mayhem. That's not to say the animation is bad or anything, but to me it felt like the movie didn't have an identity. It didn't help having all the pop music needle drops either.This movie will be incredibly dated in just 10 years with all its modern references, but hey it's fun now and that's all that really matters.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the movie, but don't hold your breath for anything crazy like the Spider-Verse movies this film was so clearly trying to copy.",

In the middle of this, the city is under attack from the criminal mastermind, Superfly (Ice Cube), a giant, sludgy bug who's got the local crime monopoly under his control. Cue a run in with cool, streetwise aspiring reporter April O' Neill (Ayo Edibiri), with whom they strike a deal: they'll let her into their world, in return for positive exposure in the social media world April is fluent with.I tend to be fairly loyal, with any franchise with a long established fan base, as it goes through the years, meaning different things to new generations in new incarnations. One that maybe drifted away was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which remained fundamentally aimed at kids, without the dark potential to explore, like with the Batman films. And so Mutant Mayhem, the latest version of the original cartoon, passed me by, especially with 'permanent teenager' Seth Rogan, who I'm no great fan of, being one of the writers and producers. But, I've finally given it a go on streaming...and it's even worse than I thought, for reasons I'd never have thought.Directors Geoff Rowe and Kyle Spears are going with an experimental style with the animation, which may appeal to some, but comes off as crude and garish to those of a certain taste. But what's even worse is how they've mangled the characters and their backstories. Jackie Chan's Splinter has morphed from his original calm, restrained manner, into some funky hipster, who plays them old school hip hop tunes that came out before most of the target demographic were born, and won't remember. To be fair, the Turtles retain their original distinctive characteristics, but what is up with Donatello's voice, sounding like some infant who's just learned to talk?!? No wonder it seems voiceover artist Micah Abbey is the only one too embarrassed to have a publicity headshot.Crucially, though, the plot is threadbare, the humour has far more misses than hits, and the whole thing feels like a hideous mangling of the original version, that hints it may be time for the Turtles to put their weapons back in their holsters. *",

The script was the same, very immature.I felt like there were lots of nods to different popular things to try and score brownie points with everyone, such as BTS and Attack in Titan.The whole thing was just boring and fell flat. It was quite simply a bit of boring feature length cartoon.Just nothing to like with a kids story that did nothing, kids dialogue that was annoying and a soundtrack and art style that didn't really work.Yet another disappointment.I'm actually getting so disappointed with Hollywood films that are complete rubbish, getting decent reviews that I am probably going to return to not watching films out of the US anymore.

They changed the origin story which might which could have been okay if it was well-written, but that was not the case. Everything seemed so bland and unbelievable. I almost lost it when there was a scene where Splinter was sitting in a couch scrolling through his cell phone like an old man having nothing else to do. The writers tried so hard to be smart and funny but to me failed at all levels. Most of the jokes didn't land and I couldn't care less or sympathize with most of the characters. This seems like one of those \"modern\" remakes that are so popular these days. I could almost feel Seth Rogen's touch all over the material.

                "review_text": "Nerd Turtles (2023) is a batch of sensory overload and gross animation. Junk food for the mind. It actually made me feel sick after watching, and I don't know if that's done intentionally.I would have nice things to say about TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, but for whatever reason, it just makes me feel awful discussing the fact that I watched it, so without wasting time, here's a hot take on the movie instead:I'd probably enjoy this movie a lot more if I were a kid, but being honest, I think even the most die-hard Ninja Turtle fans know this movie didn't live up to their expectations. For one, the style is fitting, but it lacks in delivery for a number of reasons. Some of the character designs are freakishly off-putting for some reason. Not the main turtle designs, but a lot of the others. April O'Neil, at many points, had eye problems. (I'm not sure if I'm the only one who noticed that.)Another problem with making a movie in the same vein as Spider-Verse is that, while TMNT: Mutant Mayhem doesn't directly copy the style verbatim, it does strike me as being a little bit low quality for trying to replicate the personality without understanding why the personality of Spider-Verse worked in the first place. Spider-Verse 1 and 2 may have set a high bar for what could be accomplished with visual aesthetics, but they never sacrificed simplicity. On the other hand, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem tries to do it's own thing, but at the expense of battering the Ninja Turtle source material in order to fit in. There were other problems with the animation outside of this, but I'll give the movie a pass in this area.The writing is so generic, it actually makes me want to cry. There could be so much more done with this franchise, and if they do make a sequel, I'm hoping they learn from what stunk about Mutant Mayhem, because a lot of the writing had its high points and a lot more low points. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the premise, and the ideas stick to the wall, but without spoiling anything, it's clear this movie is made to hype up the next movie and not as its own stand-alone film. This is the \"how do you do, fellow kids\" to the Ninja Turtles franchise.I am able to tolerate this movie, I just don't want to think about it anymore. I'll give credit where credit is due and say that it didn't eat me inside, but it just makes me not want to look at another pop culture reference ever again. This movie had too many of those, to which I will add, \"Am I not turtley enough for the turtle club?\" If what I said was hard for you to endure, that's how I felt about this movie. *sigh*",

There were parts where it looked almost like claymation mixed with illustration or something.This is the first time I've seen the Turtles treated like actual TEENAGERS. I said so to a couple of people who said \"Didn't they always act like Teenagers?\" to which I say NO. They acted like Surfers. They also made an effort to incorporate some more of the comic/cartoon characters that people are less familiar with, which I thought was nice.The movie was not without flaws. First off, there's no Shredder. I get that he's not the only villain, but I was hoping for some Shredder. The soundtrack was mostly fine, but they repeatedly used the song \"Ante Up\" like it was the theme of the movie and that song very flatly glorifies armed robbery. If you're going to gear your movie towards kids, maybe be a little more conscious of the messages you're sending. Also I don't mind the basic changes to April, but why did they shape her like a potato?Overall it was an enjoyable enough kids movie for an adult to get through, it had some genuine humor and writing to it which I did not expect.",

Maybe it needs to be portrayed in such a maner to wake us up. The mirror is funny, but harsh at the same time.Some friends are a huge fan ans some are definitely not. I am somewhat in the middle, but am still ruminating.",

The political messages were present but not too in your face, more a sort of background thought as you leave the cinema. As a 49 year old woman I can't say it spoke to me deeply or shocked nd surprised me any way but I did get some laughs. Margot and Ryan are brilliant and I'm sure will soon be reunited in a prequel or sequel. Calling it now.",

I just didn't get around to seeing it and I'm so glad. It would obviously bore young children, but how did it not bore every other adult as well? What a lame comedy-only one scene made me chuckle, the rest of the \"funny\" parts made me roll my eyes. I'd say it's more of a tween movie, or even teen if you keep them under a rock. But I don't know what the excuse is for adults thinking it's an amazing, brilliant comedy. And the whole deep part was pretty lame as soon as we saw that Barbie realized that the real world isn't how it is in hers.",

Loved this side of it, and I remember seeing lots of YouTube videos that went over all the details and how they are connected to real life or to other media. It also has a really good pacing, and overall feels more like an adult fairytale. Which may not be something for everyone, obviously.I remember when it just came out a lot of people were praising the show for how females are portrayed, and bashed it for how males are portrayed. And there were some who did the reverse. I would say that both sides are correct. Not to go too much into details, patriarchy is depicted as the evil of the world, and matriarchy is the only way to save it. This is not only not true, but it is also shallow, and ignoring real examples of matriarchic rule.At the same time, the movie does touch upon real issues that men face in real life, like the need to fight for even a slither of attention. This is good, but it gets kind of brushed off at the end, almost as if it did not matter, that that's what brought about Kendome. \"Kenough\" shirt is a good message, but it gets overpowered by the main message, that it is enough for women to just be ordinary. Which is also a good message, but...\nThe movie just forgot that in reality you need equality. You need both sides to be present and finding common ground. It is ok to be ordinary for both sides, and both sides can do amazing things. To be honest, for more than first half of the movie, I thought that would be the final message, but in the end it was muddied by \"women are better\", which felt disingenuous and worsened overall experience. The final scene, though did even more damage, but maybe I just did not get it, since I am a guy.Either way, it was more or less an enjoyable experience. Overhyped? Probably yes. Worth a watch? Also, probably yes, if you temper your expectations.",

Why is not any joy found in being yourself? This is a kid's toy. The film is aimed at teens and adults which don't care for Barbies anyway.The plot was all over the place - The empowerment of women, Barbie becomes real, a rom-com, an action movie, etc. And what was with the random dance numbers and singing? Part musical, part comedy,part parody, part drama equals a hot mess.I loved Margot in I,Tonya but this was a disaster.",

Since I had read no reviews and had not talked to anyone who had seen it, I went in quite objectively. Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third. I started looking at the clock which is not a good sign. The cast is good, although Ryan Gosling isn't dull enough to be Ken. He is never boring, even at the beginning. I'm glad I saw this because it is a cultural phenomenon (even though it doesn't deserve it). The message is a good one and spot on. It's just delivered in a less than stellar way.",

The animation is slightly outdated where it now looks like cut-scenes from the game Read Dead Redemption 2 (2018), but if you set your mind like it's 2009, it's actually visually stunning. The movie has a great attention to details, and there's a lot to discover during the protagonist Scrooge's journey. I personally find it less enjoyable from when Scrooge gets hunted by the coachman until he sees his own tombstone because the action feels more coincidental than purposeful, but that's only for that part. The rest is very captivating and touching. Anyway, it's noticeable that the actors do their best because their performances perfectly complete the characters, and the cinematography and the fantastic sound design make the movie a great example of an experience fitting for the big screen. The score also helps to create a diverse atmosphere that introduces vibes like Christmas in general, but also suspense and excitement. Overall, the movie contains a beautiful story with a unique experience for the Christmas holiday.This is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant movie that offers a unique cinematic experience. The animation may be slightly outdated, but the performances, cinematography, and sound design are all top-notch. A must-see for anyone seeking a captivating Christmas story.",

But as always he utterly overacted each role, putting the many fine nuances of Dickens's extraordinary classic into the background. Fortunately, he was unable to make this inconsistent travesty of the original story any worse: it was so bad, so full of preposterous variations on the original, that it would have been impossible to bring it lower. As the movie progresses, scenes increasingly diverge from the original until the beautiful messages Dickens embedded in the story are overwhelmed by pretentious and unnecessary histrionics. As I say, the worst if the 30 something versions I've seen.",

The style and how each visit was different from one to another was breathtaking at times. But why only 7 stars.In the book there was a very important bit of writing that goes as such. 'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it.' cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end.' It might just be one of the most important lessons in the book. Eb was appealed by his father which made him the person he was and by those words of the spirit he understood the \"why\" behind being generous, charitable and furthering mankind. It is a great lesson for this era.",

Gorgeous scenery, intriguing camera angles and Scrooge's familiar character arc from curmudgeon to repentant soul trying to get things right.The not so good? The first two ghosts (also played by Carrey) are obnoxiously weird. Christmas Past looks like Jim Carey's smirking head floating incongruously above a wispy phantom torso. And Christmas Present is a jarring, cackling boor, with forced belly laughing at the most bizarre times.This is not a movie for young viewers. From the beginning funeral for Marley, complete with coins on the dead man's eyes, it is (as originally written) a macabre tale filled with terrifying images. The ghost of Marley is horrific.Most of the motion capture is mesmerizing, with only a few supporting characters looking flat and poorly animated.The film also cries out for a more inspiring musical score, instead relying on the crazy antics of multiple characters performed by Carrey to move the story along.Despite all this, I recommend it as a true book to movie transition, with some beautiful visuals.",

As for the dialog, kinda boring and parts of the spirits were either to vague to hear or just annoying.Jim Carrey performed okay but it's rather monotone overall. Same goes with the spirits. The movie was visually appealing but the tone was rather plain and could of been better. It's like you have one emotion and one emotion only throughout the movie.

The sheer will and effort of Jim Carrey smashes this one out of the park and makes it a Christmas classic.Zemeckis really dragged out some shots, like the scene with the sign above the shop. The car-chase with a miniature Scrooge went on for AGES, I mean, Ebenezer is clearly terrified already by the prospect of his imminent demise. Does he really need pursuing by a carriage pulled by hell-beasts?Lastly, the grotesqueness of the characters is likely the most accurate portrayal of Victorian poor people but hilariously this is almost certainly a shortcoming of the animation style they chose to use.",

The animation throughout the movie was spectacular while also giving off very disturbing vibes throughout certain scenes.

Throughout the entire interaction I was both enthralled by the movements the camera used to convey motion throughout the town and at the same time horrified by the way the ghost of Christmas past interacted with scrooge during his death. The casting I thought was amazing and it's always good to see Jim Carrey not just play a comedy role but instead play a more serious, down to earth character. The only criticism I think I have to point out is that the movie's story is just like other movies out there. Someone who hates Christmas but later learns his lesson and becomes a joyful man has been used so much and probably done better by other movies that I have to deduct a single point. Other than that this movie is one that I feel like can be enjoyed by everyone in the family and I would totally recommend it for the holiday season.",
